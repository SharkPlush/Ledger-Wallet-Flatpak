# Ledger-Live-Flatpak

THIS BRANCH IS FOR AN APPIMAGE FLATHUB BUILD IF ANYONE WANTS TO PUBLISH

Not affilated with the Ledger company in anyway.

Flatpak manifest to build Ledger Live Desktop from source.

WARNING!!

I made this for MYSELF and for MY PERSONAL USE.

If you use this don't come crying to me if your wallet gets drained I don't know how secure this is.

You've been warned.

This was made using the Flatpak-Builder from OpenSUSE's Tumbleweed Distrobox container so if you have issues I don't know try that.

All the manifest does is download the souce from Ledger and packs it up into a Flatpak, it also enables Wayland by default. Simple and easy nothing else.

To build and install the Flatpak first modify the file .yml and the .desktop files accordingly then run.

flatpak-builder --install --user --force-clean build-dir com.Ledger.LedgerLive.yml

In the same directory as the manifest file.

For your Linux device to see your Ledger via USB check here.

Or just run.

wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bash

Whatever you're comfortable with.
